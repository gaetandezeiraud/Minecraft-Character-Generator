# Minecraft Character Generator

Nothing fancy, just a web tool to generate Minecraft skin (here in HD but easy to modify in the code) from separate images.   
Like an editor in an RPG. It is possible to add new "source" images for more variety.

No update, no new feature are provided. It was originally designed for a server called "Alt√©a Reborn" which has since been abandoned. For skin generation for players and NPCs.
